DEPLOYMENT

The recommended way to deploy Nova is by using Mup, at least v1.0.3.

Configuration

You should have a Linux server online, for instance a Digital Ocean droplet running with Ubuntu.

Install globally the latest kadirahq/meteor-up.

npm install -g mup
Create Meteor Up configuration files in your project directory with mup init. In the example below, the configuration files are created in a .deploy directory at the root of your app.

cd my-app-folder
mkdir .deploy
cd .deploy
mup init
This will create two files :

mup.js - Meteor Up configuration file
settings.json - Settings for Meteor's settings API
Then, replace the content of the newly created settings.json with your own settings (you can use the content of sample_settings.json as a starter).

Fill mup.js with your credentials and optional settings (check the Mup repo for additional docs).

Note: the ROOT_URL field should be the absolute url of your deploy ; and you need to explicitly point out to use abernix/meteord:base docker image with a docker field within the meteor object.

...
meteor: {
  ...
  path: '../' // relative path of the app considering your mup config files
  env: {
        ROOT_URL: 'http://nova-app.com', // absolute url of your deploy
        ...
  }, 
  ...
  docker: {
        image:'abernix/meteord:base' // docker image working with meteor 1.4 & node 4
  },
  ...
},
...
You can take inspiration (or copy/paste) on this mup.js example.

Setup your server

From this folder, you can now setup Docker & Mongo your server with:

mup setup 
Deploy your app to your server

Still in the same folder, to deploy your app with your settings file:

mup --settings settings.json

Production: specify the path to settings.json in the tool you use to deploy (i.e. mup deploy --settings settings.json, see below)
